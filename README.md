# Analyze-and-Visualize-Eye-Tracking-Data
Fixation identification, which involves isolating and identifying 
fixations and saccades in eye-tracking protocols, is an important 
aspect of eye-movement data processing that can have a big 
impact on higher-level analyses. However, fixation identification
techniques are frequently discussed informally and rarely 
compared in any meaningful way. With two state-of-the-art 
algorithms, we will implement fixation detection and analysis in 
this work. The velocity threshold fixation algorithm is the first 
algorithm, and it identifies fixation based on a threshold value.
For eye movement detection, the second approach is U'n' Eye, a 
deep neural network algorithm. The goal of this project is to 
analyze and visualize eye-tracking data from an eye gaze dataset 
that has been provided. The data was collected in a scenario in 
which individuals were shown photos and asked whether or not 
they recognized them. The results of the two-fixation detection 
approach are contrasted and visualized in this paper
